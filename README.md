## brief
The Fleet Management Project analyzes trip data, expenses, and resource use to improve efficiency and cut costs. It examines trip types, monthly trends, salaries, and reliance on hired transport to identify savings and optimize operations, ensuring smarter resource allocation and smoother workflows.
## project-objective
The goal of the Fleet Management analysis is to make managing trips and resources more efficient. By analyzing data on trips, expenses, and resource use, it aims to find ways to save money, make better decisions, and improve how the fleet operates overall.
## dataset used
- <a href ="https://github.com/Akanksha311/fleet-management-transportation-and-logistics-dashboard/blob/main/fleet_managemnet_transportation_and_logistics_dashboard_and_analysis.xlsx" a>Dataset</a>
## process
- varify data for any missing values and anomalies.
- make sure data is consistent and clean according to the data type.
- pivot table have been constructed according to problems.
- merged all the pivot tables using a slicer into a dashboard to make it dynamic.

## project insights
- Total Trips: A total of 24 trips were recorded.
- Hired Transportation: Out of all trips, 19 trips did not use hired transportation.
- January Expenses: The monthly expenses for January were ฿3200.
- Trip Classification: Trips classified as "Close" were the most common, contributing to the total count of trips.
- Driver Salaries in January: The total driver salary for January was ฿800.
## final conclusion
The analysis of the fleet management and logistics data highlights key operational metrics and provides actionable insights into trip classifications, transportation modes, and cost distribution. Here are the primary conclusions:
- Trip Characteristics: The majority of trips are classified as "Close," indicating a focus on short-distance transportation, which may influence vehicle wear and maintenance schedules.
- Transportation Choices: Hired transportation was used sparingly, accounting for only 20.83% of trips. This indicates a preference or capability for utilizing in-house fleet resources.
- Cost Management: Monthly expenses, including driver wages and trip-related costs, are distributed with notable peaks in January (฿3200) and June (฿3600). This suggests seasonal variations or higher operational activity during these periods.
- Driver Compensation: Average driver wages per trip are calculated at ฿466.67, with a January total of ฿800, reflecting a balance between fair compensation and cost efficiency.
- Goods Transported: "Woodchip" emerged as the most frequently transported cargo type, signifying its importance in the operational scope.
## recommendation
- Route Optimization: Investigate opportunities to further optimize "Close" trips for fuel efficiency and time management.
- Fleet Utilization: Review in-house fleet performance to identify if expanding or upgrading vehicles could reduce reliance on hired transportation during peak periods.
- Cost Analysis: Conduct a detailed review of expense spikes during January and June to pinpoint areas for potential savings.
- Driver Incentives: Consider enhancing incentive structures to maintain high performance while keeping operational costs manageable.
- Cargo Handling: Assess specialized equipment or strategies to improve efficiency in transporting woodchips.
